# Country Background
- .bold[France is a developed country]
- .bold[Mexico is a developing country]

# Stucture of this section
- .bold[Observe the developing trend with the changes of working hours and GDP within each country]
- .bold[Compare these two diffrent counties to calculate their average working time and GDP]

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#process data
sec3_data <- Analysis_Data %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c("France", "Mexico"),
         Year >= 1970) %>%
  rename(Country = Entity,
         Ave_working_hours = 'Average annual hours worked by persons engaged (avh) (PWT 9.1 (2019))',
         GDP = 'Output-side real GDP per capita (gdppc_o) (PWT 9.1 (2019))',
         Population = 'Population (historical estimates)')

```{r timechanges, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.height=4, fig.cap="The Development of Average Working Hours and GDP with the Year Changes"}
sec3_figure <- sec3_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = "Ave_working_hours":"GDP",
               names_to = "type",
               values_to = "workinghours_or_GDP") 

  ggplot(sec3_figure) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year,
                y = workinghours_or_GDP,
                color = Country)) +
  facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free_y")
```

- The left part figure shows that the average annual hours worked by persons are guadually decreased in both of two countries from the year of 1970 to 2017. 

- The right part figure indicates that the overall trend of the output-side real GDP per capita  shows a continuous rise in the same period.

```{r relationship, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.height=4, fig.cap="The Camparation between Average Working Hours and GDP"}
ggplot(sec3_data) +
    geom_line(aes(x = GDP,
                  y = Ave_working_hours,
                  color = Country)) 
```

- The Figure \@ref(fig:relationship) shows that the per capita working hours in France and Mexico show a declining trend as GDP increases.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sec3_table <- sec3_data %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(Working_hours = round(mean(Ave_working_hours, na.rm = TRUE),0),
            GDP = round(mean(GDP, na.rm = TRUE),0))
```

```{r comparation, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width='80%', fig.height=6}
kable(sec3_table, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "The Comparation of Average Working Hours and GDP between France and Mexico")
``` 

- It can be found from the table that the France has a lower working hours and a higher GDP compared with Mexico with 1,640 hours and 26,998 dollors respectively. And people in Mexico work around 2,297 hours and GDP per capita is around 12,339 dollors.

# Conclusion (France & Mexico)

.content-box-duke-green[ 
* While average earnings have risen, hours worked have fallen. 
]
.content-box-duke-green[ 
* Working hours tend to decrease as countries become richer.
