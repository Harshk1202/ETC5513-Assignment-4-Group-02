# Research Question
.content-box-duke-green[ 
* How do the average annual hours worked relates to the GDP in different countries from the year of 1970 to 2017?
]

.content-box-soft[ 
- Workers in rich countries tend to be shorter than workers in poor countries. Because in richer countries, workers per hour production capacity is higher, which means that people there have the higher income and less working hours. Therefore, the dramatic differences between different countries working time on how we look at the past two centuries of economic progress and the essence of the inequality between countries today has an important impact.

.content-box-soft[From the above plots, it is clear that in India, the Average working hours and GDP both are increasing but not as compared to UK. On the other hand, in UK, Average working hours are decreasing continuously while GDP is going up. Therefore, GDP does not solely depend on working hours or we can say that, in richer country, UK, people work for lesser number of hours as compared to India with low GDP. In India, the population has increased to a great extent and in UK, the increase has not been that much, therefore this huge increase in population might be another reason for India's falling short in GDP growth.]

- The left part figure shows that the average annual hours worked by persons are gradually decreased in both of two countries from the year of 1970 to 2017. 

- The right part figure indicates that the overall trend of the output-side real GDP per capita  shows a continuous rise in the same period.

- The figure above shows that the per capita working hours in France and Mexico show a declining trend as GDP increases.

- It can be found from the table that the France has a lower working hours and a higher GDP compared with Mexico with 1,640 hours and 26,998 dollors respectively. And people in Mexico work around 2,297 hours and GDP per capita is around 12,339 dollors.

# Conclusion

For this study, we took 8 countries ( China, USA, India, UK, France, Mexico, Australia & Indonesia) and analysed their respective GDP growth with respect to Hours of Work which each person does on an average in one year. After the analyzation, we found that GDP growth does not solely depend on Working hours and also, people in richer countries work for lesser number of hours. There can be many factors for this like population and how efficiently people are working and what are the resources available for people in rich countries with the help of which they are able to complete more work in less number of hours.
